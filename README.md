# HR Analytics Dashboard Project

This is a small project demonstrating how I used Power BI to create a dashboard for HR analytics.

## Data Source
The original dataset was sourced from [The Forage](https://www.theforage.com/virtual-experience/a87GpgE6tiku7q3gu/pw-c-switzerland/power-bi-cqxg/).

## Data Preparation
I performed several custom modifications to the original dataset and merged it with additional data from other sources to fill in missing information. These enhancements allowed for a more comprehensive use of Power BI's capabilities in this project.

## Key Files
- **`BTL.pbix`**: Contains the major changes and the Power BI dashboard.
- **`output.csv`**: The final dataset used for the dashboard.

This project showcases the process of data integration, transformation, and visualization using Power BI.
